-According to the dataset, there are 12 months on Mars (as this is the largest integer returned under the "month" column).
-According to the dataset, there are 1867 Martian days worth of data.
-According to the dataset, the average minimum daily temp is -76.12104981253347 degrees. The chart below shows that month 8 is the warmest, and month 3 is the coldest.

-Based on the line graph below, I can visually estimate that a Martian year consists of 600-700 terrestrial (Earth) days. As you can see below, there is an obvious pattern of temperatures - if we assume that the year begins at 0, the pattern ends and subsequently begins again around the 600-700 tick mark.
